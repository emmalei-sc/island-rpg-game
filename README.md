# Stuck - An Island RPG Game

*Stuck* is a mini-RPG game I created in my senior year of high school, as a final project:
> You are a mushroom who has crash-landed onto a near-deserted island. With the help of the resident hermit, use the island's resources to find your way back home!

This project was created in spring 2020 for AP Computer Science.
